//The branch instruction operates by adding the PC with the 12 bits of the
//instruction shifted left by 1 bit.
//a 12-bit offset used to compute the branch target address relative to
//the branch instruction address beq x1, x2, offset
// To compute the branch target address, the branch datapath includes an immediate generation unit and an adder.
